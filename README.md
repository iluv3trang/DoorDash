How the way people eat is changing significantly in the modern world. In the past, restaurant- quality meal delivery was limited. Nowadays, with significant advancements in digital technology and shifts in consumer expectations, the food delivery ecosystem has experienced exponential growth during the COVID-19 global pandemic and has expanded steadily, greatly impacting the dine-in restaurant business. DoorDash is one of the most popular online food ordering platforms among the four top-rated food delivery services: Grubhub, Uber Eats, Postmates, and ChowNow. The platform operates in many cities across the United States and in other countries as well, serving as a connection between consumers, technology-driven delivery networks, and local restaurants. It functions as a third-party aggregator, offering customers a convenient way to quickly access menus, prices, order customization, food orders, and delivery tracking [1]. The company generates a substantial portion of its revenue through commission charges from partner restaurants, customer delivery and service fees, subscription plans, advertising, catering services, and customer tips to Dashers [2]. Do you know that the dominance of food delivery services has led to a 27% year-over-year increase in DoorDash's revenue, leading to a market capitalization of $39.37 billion in 2023 [3]? This achievement positions DoorDash as one of the most valuable companies and has been recognized in Fortune’s Future 50 Companies in 2023 [4].
To gain deeper insights into DoorDash's operations and performance, a study was conducted by examining a large historical dataset containing all delivery order records received by DoorDash in early 2015. This dataset provides comprehensive information, including timestamps of order submission and completion, store details, order protocol systems, customer order characteristics, and market features. Delivery time is a crucial factor for customer satisfaction in the food delivery business. The primary objective of this study is to assist the business by developing a model to predict the accuracy of total delivery duration. This analysis aims to understand how DoorDash operates efficiently to enhance customer experience, gain insights, and refine strategies to keep DoorDash competitive and successful in the food delivery market.
Main objective:
❖ Identify Influencing Factors
Analyze and determine the main factors affecting delivery efficiency and enhance the overall delivery process.
❖ Formulate Strategic Recommendations
Present strategies and approaches to optimize the total delivery time and increase profits.
To achieve these objectives, data mining techniques and machine learning algorithms will be employed to conduct further analysis in this study.
